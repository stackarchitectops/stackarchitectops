# Stack Architect

## Architecture First

Designing structured systems that improve execution and operational performance.

I build workflow architecture and automation infrastructure — disciplined, extensible systems engineered for scale.

## Strategic Focus

- Modular system design  
- Automation frameworks  
- Operational tooling  
- Applied AI orchestration  
- Process optimization  

## Operating Model

Constraint → Structure → Execution → Documentation → Scale  

## Principle

Architecture creates leverage.  
Structure compounds.
