# Stack Architect  
Amber Boudreau · Systems & Automation

---

## Architecture First

Designing structured systems that improve execution and operational performance.

I build disciplined automation frameworks and modular tooling designed for clarity, repeatability, and scale.

---

## Active Build Track

Currently constructing foundational systems in:

- CLI tooling
- Workflow automation
- System design documentation
- Applied AI orchestration

---

## Development Pipeline

- System modeling  
- Deterministic implementation  
- Iterative testing  
- Structured documentation  
- Scalable refinement  

---

## Operating Model

Constraint → Structure → Execution → Documentation → Scale  

---

## Principle

Architecture creates leverage.  
Structure compounds.
